Not Conway's Game of Life Rules

- Rain Influence is a value of 0.1f or 0.4f given to each cell.
	- rain influence is determined if the weather of that cell is rain.
		
- Moisture is a perlin noise value that changes through simulation age that affects some chance values.
- Fertility is a 2nd perlin noise value that changes through simulation age that affects some chance values.
- Temperature is a 3rd perlin noise value that changes through simulation age that affects some chance values.

- There are 3 weather types.

- (None, Rain, Fire)

- Rain Rules

	- Rule 1: if there is a lake nearby, and passes a chance of (10% * Moisture)
	
	- Rule 2: if there is a other rain nearby, and passes a chance of (80% * Moisture)
		
- Fire Rules

	- Rule 3: if there is less than 2 lake cells nearby, and passes a chance of (0.01% * Temperature)
	
	- Rule 4: if there is less than 2 lake cells nearby, and passes a chance of (90% * Temperature)

- There are 6 Cell Types

- (Sand, Dirt, Grass, Forest, DenseForest, Lake)

- Sand Rules

	- Rule 5: if there are 2 or more Lake Cells touching that sand cell, the current cell is at least 3 generations old and passes a Chance of (30% * Moisture + RainInfluence)
		the Sand will turn to Dirt.
		
	- Rule 6: if the Cell is at least 5 generations old, and pases a chance of (25% * Fertility + RainInfluence)
		the Sand will turn to Dirt.
		
- Dirt Rules

	- Rule 7: if the cell is 4  or more generations old, and passes a chance of (30% * Fertility + Board[y][x].RainInfluence)
		the Dirt will turn to Grass.
		
	- Rule 8: if the there is 4 or more sand cells nearby, no lake cells, is 9 or more generations old, and passes a chance of (40% * Temperature + RainInfluence) 
		the Dirt will turn to Sand.

- Grass Rules

	- Rule 9: if there are 3 or more nearby Forest cells, the cell is more than 6 generations old, and passes a chance of (25% * Fertility + RainInfluence)
		the Grass will turn to Forest.
		
	- Rule 10: if there are 5 or more nearby Grass cells, the cell is more than 6 generations old, and passes a chance of (25% * Fertility + RainInfluence)
		the Grass will turn to Forest.
		
- Forest Rules

	- Rule 11: if there are 7 or more nearby Forest cells, the cell is more than 25 generations old, and passes a chance of (30% * Fertility + RainInfluence)
		the Forest will turn to DenseForest.
		
	- Rule 12: if there are 4 or more nearby Sand + Dirt cells, the Cell is at least 6 generations old, and pases a chance of (25% * Temperature + RainInfluence)
		the Forest will turn to Grass.
		
- DenseForest Rules

	- Rule 13: if there are 5 or more DenseForest Cells nearby, the current cell is at least 12 generations old and passes a Chance of (30% * Moisture + RainInfluence)
		the DenseForest will turn to a Forest (due to over crowding and death of some of the trees).
		
	- Rule 14: if the Cell is nearby 2 or more Lake cells, and passes a chance of (40% * Moisture + RainInfluence)
		the DenseForest will turn to Grass.
		
- Weather Affects Rules
	
	- Rule 15: if the cells current weather is Fire, and it passes a chance of (15% * Moisture), and is at least 10 generations old.
		the fire will "kill" any green there and turn to Dirt.
		
	- Rule 16: if the cells current weather is Fire, and it passes a chance of (25%), and is at least 10 generations old.
		the fire will "kill" any green there and turn to Sand (due to the lack of moisture to water it).
